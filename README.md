# Find-your-Airbnb-in-Madrid-
Big Data Bootcamp Final Project 

We work on a team to create a tool for Madrid Airbnb users.

The Airbnb Listings database published on the Open Data Soft web portal was used.

We use metrics such as the neighborhood, accommodation type, price, deposit and other expenses, reviews, beds, bathrooms, number of guests, and room type.

It has been made:
-Architecture and data validation.
-Cleanliness and data quality. 
-An exploratory data analysis where different boxplots and a histogram were performed.
-Data visualization with Power BI.
-Linear regression model.

All this can be seen in more detail in the written report of the project.
